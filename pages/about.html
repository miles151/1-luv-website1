      <h2>About Our Club</h2>
      <p>
        The Phoenix chapter (Arizona) launched on September 17, 2021. One Luv Motorcycle Club was built on the principles of longevity,
        family, and superiority. From the very beginning, we were blessed and welcomed by motorcycle clubs across Arizona, and we proudly
        carry that respect in everything we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        At One Luv, we believe that the road connects more than just cities—it connects people, communities, and hearts.
        Our club embraces all types of motorcycles and riders, because for us, it’s not about what you ride, but the love you bring to the ride.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first nine members of the Phoenix Chapter paved the way for our journey and set the tone for the family we are today:
        On One, DC, Dozer, Joker, Wit It, Everlast, Raptor, Holden, Smoke, and first Prospect Fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission goes beyond the thrill of the open road. We are committed to giving back to our community, supporting local organizations,
        and uplifting the youth. Whether it’s through charity rides, community outreach, or simply spreading positivity wherever we go,
        One Luv MC rides with purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We stand together as a family of riders, always promoting unity, respect, and love for one another. For us, the journey is about more than miles—
        it’s about the lasting impact we leave in the hearts of the people we reach.
        <br><strong>One God. One Family. One Luv.</strong>
